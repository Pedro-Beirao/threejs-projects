## Project information

We used THREE.js to make a 3d scene that demonstrates several concepts. From simple geometry, curves, materials, shaders, and lights.
This scene is Barbie themed.

A few noteworthy features:
- Lights projected from spotlights that cast shadows over objects.
- A mirror shader to reflect the whole scene.
- Use of Shape() to create more complex geometry.
- Curves and Nurbs
- Customization from the GUI

Scene description:

- The table contains a few items:
  - Newspaper
